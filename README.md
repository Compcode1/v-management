Purpose of This Book
This book is part of a larger structured series designed to prepare for the CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+)
certification while simultaneously building job-ready knowledge for real-world cybersecurity roles. Specifically, this
volume addresses Domain 2.0: Vulnerability Management.
Unlike conventional study guides that rely on repetition or jargon-heavy overviews, this book is built with a unique
mission:
To go deeper, connect more clearly, and prepare more intelligently by breaking through cybersecurity shorthand
and presenting concepts with the precision of scientific reasoning.
